    "##### SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is a Prime Number?\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is any number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n",
    "Examples: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,‚Ä¶.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Observations About Prime Numbers:\n",
    "* Prime numbers greater than 2 are odd: Even numbers (except 2) are not prime because they are divisible by 2.\n",
    "* Prime numbers greater than 3 are not divisible by 3: Numbers like 6,9,12,‚Ä¶ are not prime because they are divisible by 3.\n",
    "* Patterns in Primes: After 2 and 3, all prime numbers take the form 6k¬±1 (explained below).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why 6k¬±1?\n",
    "This comes from observing numbers in groups of 6. Any number can be written as: n=6k,6k+1,6k+2,6k+3,6k+4,or¬†6k+5\n",
    "Where k is any integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs Analyze:\n",
    "* 6k: A multiple of 6, not prime.\n",
    "* 6k+2: A multiple of 2, not prime.\n",
    "* 6k+3: A multiple of 3, not prime.\n",
    "* 6k+4: A multiple of 2, not prime.\n",
    "* Only 6k+1 and 6k+5 (or 6k‚àí1) might be prime.\n",
    "By checking only 6k¬±1, we skip all multiples of 2 and 3, making the algorithm faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Full Prime-Checking Algorithm:\n",
    "* Handle small numbers separately:\n",
    "* n‚â§1: Not prime.\n",
    "* n=2¬†or¬†3: Prime.\n",
    "* Check divisibility by 2 or 3: If divisible, not prime.\n",
    "* Check divisibility for numbers of the form \n",
    "* 6k¬±1, up to n: If divisible by any such number, not prime.\n",
    "* Otherwise, it‚Äôs prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why i and i+2?\n",
    "The 6k¬±1 pattern tells us:\n",
    "For any k, prime numbers greater than 3 must either be 6k‚àí1 or 6k+1.\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "k=1: 6(1)‚àí1=5, 6(1)+1=7.\n",
    "k=2: 6(2)‚àí1=11, 6(2)+1=13.\n",
    "k=3: 6(3)‚àí1=17, 6(3)+1=19.\n",
    "All other numbers (like 6k, 6k+2, 6k+3, 6k+4) are divisible by 2 or 3 and cannot be prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logic Behind i and i+2:\n",
    "Start Dividing from \n",
    "* i=5: 6(1)‚àí1, the first number in the 6k‚àí1 sequence.\n",
    "* Check i+2=7: represents 6(1)+1, the next number in the 6k+1 sequence.\n",
    "* Increment by 6: After checking i=5 and i+2=7, we skip directly to the next 6k‚àí1 and 6k+1 numbers by incrementing i by 6:\n",
    "* Next i=11: 6(2)‚àí1. i+2=13: 6(2)+1.\n",
    "* By doing this, the algorithm systematically checks only the 6k¬±1 numbers and skips all multiples of 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Insight: Factors Come in Pairs (why we take sqrt(n) limit)?\n",
    "* Any number n (except 1) can be expressed as a product of two numbers: n=a√ób\n",
    "* Here, a and b are factors of n.\n",
    "* At least one of the factors will be smaller than or equal to n:\n",
    "** If both factors a and b were greater than n, their product would exceed n: a>n and b>n ‚üπa√ób>n\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, at least one factor must be ‚â§ sqrt(ùëõ).\n",

    "\n",
    "The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The GCD of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How the Euclidean Algorithm Works\n",
    "1. The algorithm is based on the principle that:\n",
    "GCD(a,b)=GCD(b,a mod b)\n",
    "2. This means the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its remainder when divided by the smaller number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### STEPS \n",
    "1. Given two integers a and b (a‚â•b):\n",
    "2. Divide a by b, and find the remainder r: r=amod b. Replace a with b and b with r.\n",
    "3. Repeat the process until b=0.\n",
    "4. At this point, a will be the GCD of the original numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps with Example\n",
    "* Find the GCD of a=56 and b=98:\n",
    "1. a=56,b=98: r=98mod56=42.\n",
    "2. Replace a with 56 and b with 42. a=56,b=42: r=56 mod 42=14.\n",
    "3. Replace a with 42 and b with 14. a=42,b=14: r=42 mod 14=0.\n",
    "4. Replace a with 14 and b with 0. b=0, so the GCD is a=14."
