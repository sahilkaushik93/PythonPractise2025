    "##### SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is a Prime Number?\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is any number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n",
    "Examples: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,‚Ä¶.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Observations About Prime Numbers:\n",
    "* Prime numbers greater than 2 are odd: Even numbers (except 2) are not prime because they are divisible by 2.\n",
    "* Prime numbers greater than 3 are not divisible by 3: Numbers like 6,9,12,‚Ä¶ are not prime because they are divisible by 3.\n",
    "* Patterns in Primes: After 2 and 3, all prime numbers take the form 6k¬±1 (explained below).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why 6k¬±1?\n",
    "This comes from observing numbers in groups of 6. Any number can be written as: n=6k,6k+1,6k+2,6k+3,6k+4,or¬†6k+5\n",
    "Where k is any integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs Analyze:\n",
    "* 6k: A multiple of 6, not prime.\n",
    "* 6k+2: A multiple of 2, not prime.\n",
    "* 6k+3: A multiple of 3, not prime.\n",
    "* 6k+4: A multiple of 2, not prime.\n",
    "* Only 6k+1 and 6k+5 (or 6k‚àí1) might be prime.\n",
    "By checking only 6k¬±1, we skip all multiples of 2 and 3, making the algorithm faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Full Prime-Checking Algorithm:\n",
    "* Handle small numbers separately:\n",
    "* n‚â§1: Not prime.\n",
    "* n=2¬†or¬†3: Prime.\n",
    "* Check divisibility by 2 or 3: If divisible, not prime.\n",
    "* Check divisibility for numbers of the form \n",
    "* 6k¬±1, up to n: If divisible by any such number, not prime.\n",
    "* Otherwise, it‚Äôs prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why i and i+2?\n",
    "The 6k¬±1 pattern tells us:\n",
    "For any k, prime numbers greater than 3 must either be 6k‚àí1 or 6k+1.\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "k=1: 6(1)‚àí1=5, 6(1)+1=7.\n",
    "k=2: 6(2)‚àí1=11, 6(2)+1=13.\n",
    "k=3: 6(3)‚àí1=17, 6(3)+1=19.\n",
    "All other numbers (like 6k, 6k+2, 6k+3, 6k+4) are divisible by 2 or 3 and cannot be prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logic Behind i and i+2:\n",
    "Start Dividing from \n",
    "* i=5: 6(1)‚àí1, the first number in the 6k‚àí1 sequence.\n",
    "* Check i+2=7: represents 6(1)+1, the next number in the 6k+1 sequence.\n",
    "* Increment by 6: After checking i=5 and i+2=7, we skip directly to the next 6k‚àí1 and 6k+1 numbers by incrementing i by 6:\n",
    "* Next i=11: 6(2)‚àí1. i+2=13: 6(2)+1.\n",
    "* By doing this, the algorithm systematically checks only the 6k¬±1 numbers and skips all multiples of 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Insight: Factors Come in Pairs (why we take sqrt(n) limit)?\n",
    "* Any number n (except 1) can be expressed as a product of two numbers: n=a√ób\n",
    "* Here, a and b are factors of n.\n",
    "* At least one of the factors will be smaller than or equal to n:\n",
    "** If both factors a and b were greater than n, their product would exceed n: a>n and b>n ‚üπa√ób>n\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, at least one factor must be ‚â§ sqrt(ùëõ).\n",
